> It is envisioned that wireless networks of the future will support personalized, fine-grained services and decisions by predicting user satisfaction in real-time using machine learning and big data analytics. Data-driven personalization will empower wireless networks to further optimize resources while maintaining user expectations of networks. 

> In order to design, test, and validate research ideas related to wireless network personalization, we designed a synthetic user behavior datasets for four distinct personas. The datasets are designed to mimic the real characteristics of real datasets. 

> More details on the datasets and user satisfaction design can be found in the following published papers:

## User Satisfaction Model


The dataset generation model is based on the user satisfaction model shown below.  For more details, checkout the references listed at the end of this guide.

## Data Generation Process

> One of the main design requirements of synthetic datasets
is that they need to be similar to real-world data. In order to create user behaviour dataset with realistic charactristics, we develop and used the concept of Tree Data Generartors (TG). 

> Here is an example of a TG for the working profeesional persoan.

## Data 
> The Datatsets can be downloaded from the following link: 

> The Datasets included in this repo represets four users personas:

- Working Professional (WP)
- High School Student (HSS)
- University student (US)
- Homemaker (HM)

> Each dataset is generated for a one year period. 

> Data for each persona is split into 6 folders.  Each folder contains data generated for two months. 

> Data for each month is split into 3 csv files. 

> Each csv file is named as: 
- Persona Name+month+Part number, 
where Persona Name={WP,HSS,US,HM}, Part number ={one, two, three} and month= {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12}.


# Getting Started

### Extract Data 🔨🔨🔨

> Datasets folders are compresed to reduce size. You need to extract all files before reading the CSVs.




### Read data 

Datasets are stored in multiple csv. The following example illustrates how to read the WP persona dataset in one dataframe: 

```python

import pandas as pd

df_WP=pd.DataFrame()
for mon in range(1,12):
    for part in ['one','two','three']:
        path='WP'+str(mon)+part+'.csv'
        df=pd.read_csv(path, sep=',')
        df_WP=df_WP.append(df)
    
```


### Understanding the dataset



> Each dataset has a set of features (or context variables) and two labels , Satisfaction and satisfaction with noisy lambda.

# Datasets visualization

> In this section, In order to understand the correlation and data structure generated by the TG generator, we visiulize some of the dataswet features.

> The following figures are generated using notebook WP-Visualization.ipynb included in this repo.

### User Satisfaction Histogram

### User Satisfaction vs. Histogram
> In order to visualize the correlation between user satisfaction behavior and time period, we plot the user satisfaction histogram vs. time period.

### User Activity Histogram 

> In order to visualize the correlation between location, days, and  activity, we plot the histogram of the recorded instances on a weekday and a weekend day for the six activities at two locations.

### Heatmap

> Here we visualize the correlation between the dataset context features through a heatmap.

###  User location vs. Time period Percentage Plot
> Here, to visually see the relationship between time period and location for WP persona, we plot the percentage of time the user spent at each location over each time period on a weekday and a weekend day.
